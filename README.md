Civics 101: The Electoral College
Client: David Wolber

Project Overview:
This is a web app based on the books, “Tyranny of the Minority” and “How Democracies Die”, by Steven Levitsky and Daniel
 Ziblatt. The focus is on how the US can improve democracy in practical ways. Users can learn more about these books by
interacting with ChatGPT, listening to a podcast, or taking quizzes on the content. This can be used in classrooms to
facilitate learning or be used by individuals to get to know a content better. After this class is over, I'm hoping to
add a function where users can upload their own material and have the website complete the same tasks.

Database Description:
This will be a RAG application with book and article contents. All contents will be stored in Firebase. Longer content
will potentially be stored by chapters/sections for easy access.
Firebase will also store user info, progress and chat history.

AI Description:
The podcasts will be generated by NotebookLM and the interactive chat and quizzes will be generated by ChatGPT.
